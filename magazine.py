"""Assemble an issue of the workshop magazine from the files the members wrote.

This is the piece that makes the bench a cohort rather than a game. A member's life is not a round: it is
a beat (what it is interested in), a soil (the world it is standing in), and a pile of works — pieces,
catalogues, a game, letters to each other about those works. The magazine is the thing that makes the
pile a *publication*: it takes what exists on disk, gives it an order, and shows the peer responses next
to the thing responded to.

Everything here is derived from files. There is no editorial judgement in this program and no stored copy
of a work: if a member wants its piece in the issue, the piece is in `works/`, and the assembler reads it
out of there. Hand-editing an issue is pointless — it is regenerated.

    python3 magazine.py --issue 1            print the issue
    python3 magazine.py --issue 1 --write    write issues/01.md
    python3 magazine.py --list               what works exist, and which issue each is in
